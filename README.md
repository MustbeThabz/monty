pint Prints the value at the top of the stack.

pop Removes the to element of the stack.

add Adds the top two elements of the stack. The result is then stored in the second node, and the first node is removed.

nop This opcode does not do anything.

sub Subtracts the top two elements of the stack from the second top element. The result is then stored in the second node, and the first node is removed.

div Divides the top two elements of the stack from the second top element. The result is then stored in the second node, and the first node is removed.

mul Multiplies the top two elements of the stack from the second top element. The result is then stored in the second node, and the first node is removed.

mod Computes the remainder of the top two elements of the stack from the second top element. The result is then stored in the second node, and the first node is removed.
